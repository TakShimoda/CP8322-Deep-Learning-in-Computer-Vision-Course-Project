# CP8322-Deep-Learning-in-Computer-Vision-Course-Project
Course project: reproducibility challenge for the course CP8322: Deep Learning in Computer Vision.

We attempt to reproduce the results of the paper: __Learning in the Frequency Domain__ available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12416

Please see the README.md to run ResNet-50 on the ILSVRC 2012 image classification task on the validation set.
